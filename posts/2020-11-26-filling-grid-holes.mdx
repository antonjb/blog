CSS Grid enables responsive elements with variable sized grid items all without media queries. You may have hit a problem though. After creating different sized grid items there are holes left in the layout where a grid item didn’t fit. The spec writers thought of this scenario and with grid-auto-flow, you utilise a packing algorithm to fill those holes with grid items as they’re found.

[Here’s the CodePen example](https://codepen.io/antonjb/pen/LYZvxve) of the layout we are going to create. It’s a grid of card items with banner-like cards every seventh item.

The code for this layout can be boiled down to this:

```css
ul {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-flow: row dense;
}

li:nth-child(7n) {
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
}
```

Let’s take a look at the code for each technique.

## RAM (Repeat, Auto, Minmax)

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
```

[Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/una) introduced me to the acronym RAM in her article [Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS](https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/). RAM stands for Repeat, auto, minmax and the technique ensures items auto-fit to the grid and the value is no smaller than the minimum and no larger than the maximum value. It achieves responsive grid items without media queries. Awesome!

## Spanning

```css
grid-column: 1 / -1;`
```

Spanning grid item uses a technique I covered in [Superhero layout series layering panels](/blog/2020-05-19-super-hero-layout-layered-panels/), but recapping; CSS Grid lines are numbered 1 to n (n being the total number of lines) but also in reverse from -1 to -n. This allows us to set the grid columns to 1 / -1 which begins at the first grid line and ends on the last grid line, thus spanning the full width of the grid - even if the number of columns changes!

Combined with the nth-child selector we can target every 7 items in the grid:

```css
li:nth-child(7n) {
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
}
```

## Filling the gaps with grid-auto-flow

Now with responsive grid items and spanning banners we can see the hole issue which looks like this:

![Six grid items with a gap and the seventh grid item on the next line the full width of the page](/img/grid-holes/grid-holes-001.png)

To resolve this we set the following on our grid:

```css
grid-auto-flow: row dense;
```

The dense attribute tells the packing algorithm to layout grid items in a way that when it finds an item that will fill in a gap, use that item to do so. We now have all the requirements of the layout.

## Keep in mind...

This approach moves the items from their defined source order. A possible accessibility issue. Depending on the layout this might not be an issue but worth considering if you take this approach. Take a look at the labels in this screenshot:

![Nine grid items number 1 to 6 then 8, 9 and 7](/img/grid-holes/grid-holes-002.png)

Notice items 8 and 9 are now before item 7, despite the source code order. If your content is reliant on the order then this technique might not be the best choice. A list of product cards though would be ok.

I hope this article has been useful in learning some tips and tricks with CSS Grid especially if you ever found yourself with gaps in your grid. Take a look at the [demo on CodePen](https://codepen.io/antonjb/pen/LYZvxve) which allows you to toggle between dense and the regular row value of grid-auto-flow. I find interactive demos like this a great way to gain an understanding of concepts.
